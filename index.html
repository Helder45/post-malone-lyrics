        <h3>Intro</h3>
        
        <p>
            You keep me wrapped around your finger
            Wrapped around your finger
            I was caught up in your orbit, spinnin' like a bullet
            I was wrapped around your finger, wrapped around your finger
            Then I shot back down to Earth
        </p>
        
        <h3>Verse 1</h3>
        
        <p>
            I can't call you right now, I been drinking
            And I know that I'll say what I'm thinking
            My whole life I was drawn to the deep end
            When will it sink in?
            Why do I tell myself that I'll do the best I can?
            I know damn well that you couldn't give a damn
            Ten billion cuties that think I'm the man
            But if you come around, I'll be eatin' out your hand
        </p>
        
        <h3>Chorus</h3>
        
        <p>
            Keep me wrapped around your finger
            Wrapped around your finger
            I was caught up in your orbit, spinnin' like a bullet
            I was wrapped around your finger, wrapped around your finger
            Then I shot back down to Earth (Shot back down to Earth)
            I keep wondering who's the one replacing me?
            Take me back to yesterday
            When I was wrapped around your finger
            Wrapped around your finger
            Then was shot back down to Earth (Shot back down to Earth)
        </p>
        
        <h3>Verse 2</h3>
        
        <p>
            When we met, you ain't know I was a singer
            You weren't impressed by all the ice on my fingers (So icy)
            I had your mom and daddy's house on my pinky (My pinky)
            If I'da known what it'd be like now
            I wouldn't be in misery right now
            Look in the mirror, I don't see myself
            Being with me has gotta be like hell
            So tell the devil I'ma be right down
        </p>
        
        <h3>Chorus</h3>
        <p>
            You keep me wrapped around your finger
            Wrapped around your finger, I was caught up in your orbit
            Spinnin' like a bullet (Spinnin' like a bullet)
            I was wrapped around your finger, wrapped around your finger
            Then I shot back down to Earth (Shot back down to Earth)
            I keep wondering who's the one replacing me? (Oh)
            Take me back to yesterday
            When I was wrapped around your finger
            Wrapped around your finger
            Then was shot back down to Earth (Shot back down to Earth)
        </p>
        <h3>Bridge</h3>
        <p>
            Yeah, I'm wrapped around, and around
            And around on your finger now (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
            You got me wrapped around, and around
            And around on your finger now (Ooh, ooh)
            I'ma be right down
